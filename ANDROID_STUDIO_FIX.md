# 🚀 Quick Fix: Android Studio Not Detecting Module

## ✅ Problem Fixed!

The Gradle wrapper was incomplete. I've downloaded the proper `gradle-wrapper.jar` file and removed the deprecated build cache option from `gradle.properties`.

---

## 📋 **Steps to Run the App in Android Studio**

### **Step 1: Sync Project with Gradle Files**

1. In Android Studio, click **File** → **Sync Project with Gradle Files**
2. Wait for the sync to complete (2-3 minutes first time)
3. Watch the bottom status bar - it should show "Build: Successful"

**What to look for:**
- Bottom status bar shows progress
- "Build" panel shows no errors
- Project structure should now show proper folders (java, res, etc.)

---

### **Step 2: Verify Module is Detected**

After sync completes, you should see:

1. **Project structure expands** to show:
   ```
   Splitwise [ExpenseSplitter]
   ├── app
   │   ├── manifests
   │   │   └── AndroidManifest.xml
   │   ├── java
   │   │   └── com.expensesplitter.app
   │   │       ├── ExpenseSplitterApplication
   │   │       ├── data
   │   │       ├── di
   │   │       └── presentation
   │   └── res
   │       ├── values
   │       │   └── strings.xml
   │       └── ...
   ```

2. **Run configuration appears** in the toolbar:
   - Dropdown shows "app"
   - Green play button ▶️ becomes enabled
   - Device dropdown appears

---

### **Step 3: Select Device**

Click the device dropdown (next to "app"):

**Option A: Use Physical Device**
- Connect your phone via USB
- Enable USB Debugging (Settings → Developer Options)
- Your device should appear in the dropdown

**Option B: Create Emulator**
- Click dropdown → "Device Manager"
- Click "Create Device"
- Select "Pixel 7" → Next
- Download a system image (API 33+) → Next → Finish

---

### **Step 4: Run the App!**

1. Make sure "app" is selected in the configuration dropdown
2. Make sure a device is selected in the device dropdown
3. Click the green play button ▶️ (or press Shift+F10)
4. Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes first time)
5. App will launch on your device/emulator!

## 🐛 **If Sync Fails**

### **Error: "gradle-wrapper.jar not found"**

Run this in Android Studio Terminal (Alt+F12):
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradle/gradle/master/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar" -OutFile "gradle\wrapper\gradle-wrapper.jar"
```

Then: File → Sync Project with Gradle Files

---

### **Error: "SDK location not found"**

1. Create file: `local.properties` in project root
2. Add this line (replace with your path):
```properties
sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
```

To find your SDK path:
- File → Settings → Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → Android SDK
- Copy the "Android SDK Location" path

---

### **Error: Build fails with dependency errors**

In Android Studio Terminal:
```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build --refresh-dependencies
```

Then: File → Sync Project with Gradle Files

---

### **Error: "Module not found" persists**

1. File → Invalidate Caches → Invalidate and Restart
2. Wait for Android Studio to restart
3. It will automatically re-index and sync

---

## 📱 **What to Expect When Running**

### **First Build:**
- Takes 2-5 minutes (downloads dependencies)
- Progress bar at bottom
- "Building 'app'" notification

### **App Launch:**
- "Installing APK..." message
- App icon appears on device
- Authentication screen loads
- "Sign in with Google" button visible

### **Testing Sign-In:**
1. Tap "Sign in with Google"
2. Select your Google account
3. Grant permissions
4. Should see success! ✅

## 📊 **Current Build Status**

The first build is currently running via command line. This will:
- Download all dependencies (~500 MB first time)
- Compile Kotlin code
- Generate Room database code (via KSP)
- Generate Hilt dependency injection code
- Create debug APK

**Wait for it to complete**, then do "Sync Project with Gradle Files" in Android Studio.

---

## 🎯 **Quick Commands**

In Android Studio Terminal (Alt+F12):

```bash
# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Build project
./gradlew build

# Build debug APK only
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on connected device
./gradlew installDebug

# View gradle tasks
./gradlew tasks
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Always sync after editing build.gradle files**
   - File → Sync Project with Gradle Files

2. **Clear cache if things get weird**
   - File → Invalidate Caches → Invalidate and Restart

3. **View build output**
   - View → Tool Windows → Build

4. **View logcat (app logs)**
   - View → Tool Windows → Logcat

5. **Gradle daemon issues?**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew --stop
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

You'll know everything is working when:

1. ✅ Project structure shows `app` module with proper folders
2. ✅ "app" appears in run configuration dropdown
3. ✅ Green play button is enabled
4. ✅ Build panel shows "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"
5. ✅ No red errors in project view
6. ✅ Can click play button and app builds/installs

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

If after syncing you still don't see the play button:

1. **Check Build Output**
   - View → Tool Windows → Build
   - Look for red error messages
   - Share the error message for help

2. **Check Event Log**
   - View → Tool Windows → Event Log
   - Look for sync errors or warnings

3. **Check Gradle Console**
   - Click "Build" tab at bottom
   - Look for detailed error messages
